# Web Development Final Project - *HobbyHub - Technology*

Submitted by: **Kyle Moore**

This web app: **This web app allows the user to view a forum regarding the topic of technology, including the latest technology, items, tips, you name it! The web app allows users to create posts and see a feed of them on the home page. It also allows one to edit, delete, or leave comments underneath them for discussions, and give upvotes for posts that they like! The user may also sort posts by created time or upvotes count which will display in descending order. Users will be able to see the time a post was created as well.**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **A create form that allows the user to create posts**
- [x] **Posts have a title and optionally additional textual content and/or an image added as an external image URL**

- [x] **Clicking on a post shall direct the user to a new page for the selected post**
- [x] **Users can sort posts by either their created time or upvotes count**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Implementing comments properly was difficult, including getting database settings, and code to properly regulate. Took much time of using console logs in terminal to investigate the issue. One issue was missing the select implementation in Supabase, while only having the insert aspect.
